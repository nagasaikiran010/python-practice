### Problem Statement: Simple Expense Tracker

**Objective:** Create a simple expense tracker application that allows users to add, view, and delete expenses, as well as calculate the total amount spent.

#### Requirements:
1. **Menu Options:**
    - Display a menu to the user with options to:
        1. Add an expense
        2. View expenses
        3. Delete an expense
        4. Calculate total expenses
        5. Exit the application

2. **Add an Expense:**
    - Prompt the user to enter a description and amount for the expense.
    - Save the expense in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the description and amount.

3. **View Expenses:**
    - Display all expenses in the list with their corresponding index numbers, descriptions, and amounts.

4. **Delete an Expense:**
    - Prompt the user to enter the index number of the expense they want to delete.
    - Remove the expense from the list.

5. **Calculate Total Expenses:**
    - Calculate and display the total amount of all expenses in the list.

6. **Exit the Application:**
    - Exit the loop and end the program when the user chooses to exit.

#### Example Interaction:
```

### Guidelines:
1. Use a loop to repeatedly display the menu until the user chooses to exit.
2. Use a list to store the expenses, with each expense represented as a dictionary.
3. Use `input()` to capture user input.
4. Handle potential errors, such as entering an invalid index number when deleting an expense or calculating the total when the list is empty.

This problem statement introduces basic concepts such as lists, dictionaries, loops, conditionals, and user input, making it suitable for beginners.
