Problem Statement: Student Grade Management System
Objective: Create a Python script to manage student grades for a class. The script should allow the user to add, view, update, and delete student records. Additionally, it should calculate the average grade, find the highest and lowest grades, and handle errors gracefully.

Requirements:
Menu Options:

Display a menu to the user with options to:
Add a student record
View all student records
Update a student record
Delete a student record
Calculate average grade
Find the highest and lowest grades
Exit the application
Add a Student Record:

Prompt the user to enter the student's name and grade.
Save the record in a dictionary, where the student's name is the key and the grade is the value.
View All Student Records:

Display all student records with their names and grades.
Update a Student Record:

Prompt the user to enter the student's name.
Allow the user to update the grade for the student.
Delete a Student Record:

Prompt the user to enter the student's name to delete.
Remove the record from the dictionary.
Calculate Average Grade:

Calculate and display the average grade of all students.
Find the Highest and Lowest Grades:

Display the student(s) with the highest and lowest grades.
Error Handling:

Handle errors such as entering a non-numeric grade or providing an invalid student name.
Provide user-friendly error messages.
Functions:

Use functions to handle each menu option and other repetitive tasks.
Define variables and manage scope appropriately.
Tuples and Sets:

Use tuples for storing individual student records if necessary.
Use sets for storing unique student names.
Example Interaction:

Guidelines:
Use a loop to repeatedly display the menu until the user chooses to exit.
Use a dictionary to store student records, with each record represented as a grade.
Use input() to capture user input.
Use conditional statements (if, elif, else) to handle menu options.
Use try and except to handle potential errors, such as invalid input.
Use list comprehensions where appropriate to make the code more concise and readable.
Use tuples and sets as needed for storing and managing data.
Define and use functions for each main feature to keep the code organized and readable.
