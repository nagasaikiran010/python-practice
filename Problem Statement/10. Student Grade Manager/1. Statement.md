 Objective: Create a Python script to manage and analyze student grades. The script should allow the user to add student names and their grades, view all students, update grades, calculate the class average, find the highest and lowest grades, and search for students by name. The script should also handle potential errors gracefully.

Requirements:

Display a menu to the user with options to:
Add a student and their grade

Update a student's grade
Calculate the class average grade
Find the highest and lowest grades
Search for a student by name
Exit the application
Add a Student and Their Grade:

Prompt the user to enter the student's name and grade.
Save the student's name and grade in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the student's name and grade.
View All Students and Their Grades:

Update a Student's Grade:

Prompt the user to enter the index number of the student they want to update.
Prompt the user to enter the new grade for the student.

Guidelines:
Use a loop to repeatedly display the menu until the user chooses to exit.
Use a list to store the students, with each student represented as a dictionary.
Use input() to capture user input.
Use conditional statements (if, elif, else) to handle menu options.
Use try and except to handle potential errors, such as invalid input.
Use list comprehensions to search for students.
Implement functions for each main feature to keep the code organized and readable.
