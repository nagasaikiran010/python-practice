Objective: Create a Python script to manage student grades. The script should allow the user to add student grades, view the list of grades, calculate the average grade, find the highest and lowest grades, and search for grades by student name. The script should also handle potential errors gracefully.

Requirements:
Menu Options:

Display a menu to the user with options to:
Add a student grade
View all student grades
Calculate the average grade
Find the highest and lowest grades
Search for a student's grades
Exit the application
Add a Student Grade:

Prompt the user to enter the student's name and grade.
Save the student grade in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the student's name and grade.
View All Student Grades:

Display all student grades with their corresponding index numbers, names, and grades.

Prompt the user to enter a student's name.
Display the grades for the student(s) that match the search term.
Error Handling:

Handle errors such as entering a non-numeric grade or providing an invalid index number.
Provide user-friendly error messages.
Exit the Application:

Exit the loop and end the program when the user chooses to exit.

Guidelines:
Use a loop to repeatedly display the menu until the user chooses to exit.
Use a list to store the student grades, with each grade represented as a dictionary.
Use input() to capture user input.
Use conditional statements (if, elif, else) to handle menu options.
Use try and except to handle potential errors, such as invalid input.
Use list comprehensions to search for student grades.
