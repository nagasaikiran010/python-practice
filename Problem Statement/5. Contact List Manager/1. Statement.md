Guidelines:
Use a loop to repeatedly display the menu until the user chooses to exit.
Use a list to store the contacts, with each contact represented as a dictionary.
Use input() to capture user input.
Handle potential errors, such as entering an invalid index number when deleting a contact or performing a search with no results.
