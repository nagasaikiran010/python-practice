Guidelines:
Use a loop to repeatedly display the menu until the user chooses to exit.
Use a list to store the budget items, with each item represented as a dictionary.
Use input() to capture user input.
Use conditional statements (if, elif, else) to handle menu options.
Use try and except to handle potential errors, such as invalid input.
Use list comprehensions where appropriate to make the code more concise and readable.
